Hello, world.

This is my first post for this blog. My first blog ever, actually.
It will hopefully be a place for me to express and share my ideas and toughts thoughout my professional career in software development.

I have a few goals in mind, when starting this blog:

- Create/improve my web presence.
- A place where I can share the projects I'm working on.
- Make a dent in the universe. Stop being anonymous.
- Improve my (english) writing.

I hope to write here whenever a problem is keeping my up at night.

This blog is built using Jekyll, and static site generator written in ruby by Tom Preston-Werner of Github.
Ironically, he has resigned within an hour of me beginning to write this post.

It’s easier to retweet than to write an essay.  
It’s easier to like an Instagram post than to take a beautiful photograph.  
It’s easier to see what people on that subreddit think than to make progress on your project.  
It’s easier to get that dopamine hit playing video games than to get it through achievements in real life.  
It’s easier to lay in bed than to work out and exercise.  
It’s easier to stare at your phone than to start a conversation.  

When you check social media for the 20th time today, does it benefit your in the long run? What do you have to show for that day?  
What if, instead, your resisted the urge and turned that energy to create something?

That consumption loop is vicious. It’s like playing a slot machine, hoping for the right link to tweet.

So resist the urge.  
Get control of yourself.  
Practice discipline.  
You know you would be better off.

Get rid of the attention seekers in your digital world.  
Enough with consuming.  
Start creating.

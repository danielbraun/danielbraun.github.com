title:  "People Are Nice"
---
I'm starting to think more and more that most people are fundamentally nice.  You
can even approach someone, introduce yourself and strike up a conversation.  I
don't know why I'm having this realization at this time in my life (I'm 28).
Maybe it's because I've been meeting many new people recently, and they've
been genuinely nice.

Maybe it's because I've personally grown lately, and learned to appreciate
qualities in people I had not seen.  Maybe it's the way I dress, look or talk.

I discussed this subject with a friend last week. She thought that
people are fundamentally good and caring, I thought the opposite.  That fact
was so obvious to her, that I'm starting to question my beliefs.

But why do I think people are fundamentally hostile in the first place?  Well,
this is what life has taught me, in all the educational institutions I've been it. Be it
high school, military and college.  Perhaps what made people hostile in these places,
at least as percieved by me, is their very nature of them.  They are institutions,
you have to be there (at least you think you have to be there)

When people no longer belong to a framework of sort, be it a university or
workplace, they can be themselves.  And I'm hoping that they're fundamentally
good.
